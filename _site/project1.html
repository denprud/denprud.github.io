            <p class="project-description">After creating notion templates that helped people manage their procrastination, I took a survey to analyze how the templates were helping them. 
                The results suggested that templates weren't helpful enough; I needed to make an app.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">I created an app that would help people manage their procrastination by restricting the user from actively using sites that aren't apart of their workflow. 
                The app change the HTML pages of the sites that they procrastinated on to make procrasination impossible when working.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">The app allowed the user to input the pages that they're working on in order for the software to not change the pages.</p>
